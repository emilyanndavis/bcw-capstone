# Capstone Project (App name TBD)

## The Basic Idea

- Pokemon in real life!
- Wildlife identification in the Boise foothills 
- A native mobile app that integrates geolocation with data about wildlife that are commonly found in the area

## Primary Goals/Features

- User should have a log where they can keep track of animals they have seen while hiking/running/biking on the trails in the Boise foothills
    - User should be able to tap on a photo of an animal in their log to get more information about that species (Pokedex-style!) 
- User should be able to look through a catalog of animals common to their area in order to identify what they have seen     
    - User should be able to use simple search and/or structured lookup (i.e., search for "chickadee" or click through "birds" >> "songbirds" to see a list of songbirds to choose from)
- User should be able to view a map of the local trails with pinpoints to indicate recent wildlife sightings
    - User should be able to tap on a pin on the map to view details about a sighting, i.e., species, date of most recent sighting, number of sightings in last week/month
- User should be able to have a wishlist where they can keep track of animals they would like to see 
    - User should be able to subscribe to alerts for animals on their wishlist, e.g., "A great horned owl was spotted on Red Fox trail this morning" or "Five red-winged blackbirds were sighted on Kestrel yesterday"
